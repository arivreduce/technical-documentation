            React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces,
            particularly for single-page applications where dynamic content is
            key. Developed and maintained by Facebook, React allows developers
            to create reusable UI components that update efficiently in response
            to changes in data. Its declarative nature makes it easier to debug
            and understand how the UI should look at any given point in time.
          </p>
          <p>
            At its core, React uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to
            optimize rendering performance. Instead of directly manipulating the
            browser's DOM, React creates a lightweight copy of it in memory,
            making updates faster and more efficient. This approach, combined
            with its component-based architecture, enables developers to build
            scalable and maintainable applications with a seamless user
            experience.

            Before diving into React, itâ€™s helpful to have a solid foundation in
            the following areas:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>HTML & CSS</strong>: Understanding how to structure web
              pages and style them is essential, as React components often
              render HTML and rely on CSS for design.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>JavaScript (ES6+)</strong>: Familiarity with modern
              JavaScript features like arrow functions, destructuring, template
              literals, and modules is crucial since React heavily relies on
              ES6+ syntax.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Basic DOM Manipulation</strong>: Knowing how to interact
              with the DOM using JavaScript will help you understand how React
              simplifies this process with its virtual DOM.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

          <p>
            React is built entirely on JavaScript, making it essential to have a
            solid understanding of the language before diving into React. React
            leverages modern JavaScript (ES6+) features extensively, such as
            arrow functions, destructuring, template literals, and modules.
            These features not only make React code more concise and readable
            but also enable developers to write more expressive and maintainable
            components. For example, React components are often written as
            JavaScript functions using arrow functions, and state management
            relies heavily on concepts like closures and the useState hook.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the key differences between plain JavaScript and React is the
            way UI updates are handled. In traditional JavaScript, you might
            directly manipulate the DOM using methods like
            document.getElementById or innerHTML. React, however, introduces a
            declarative approach where you describe what the UI should look like
            for a given state, and React takes care of updating the DOM
            efficiently. This is made possible by React's virtual DOM, which
            acts as a lightweight copy of the actual DOM and allows React to
            batch updates and minimize performance bottlenecks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another important distinction is the use of JSX (JavaScript XML), a
            syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code directly
            within JavaScript. While JSX might look like HTML, it is actually
            syntactic sugar for React.createElement calls, which are compiled
            into JavaScript by tools like Babel. This blending of HTML and
            JavaScript in JSX can feel unfamiliar at first, but it ultimately
            simplifies the process of building and visualizing component
            structures. For example, instead of writing verbose
            React.createElement statements, you can write intuitive JSX like
            <code
              >&lt;div className="container"&gt;Hello World&lt;/div&gt;</code
            >
            .
