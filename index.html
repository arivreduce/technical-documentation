            React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces,
            particularly for single-page applications where dynamic content is
            key. Developed and maintained by Facebook, React allows developers
            to create reusable UI components that update efficiently in response
            to changes in data. Its declarative nature makes it easier to debug
            and understand how the UI should look at any given point in time.

            At its core, React uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to
            optimize rendering performance. Instead of directly manipulating the
            browser's DOM, React creates a lightweight copy of it in memory,
            making updates faster and more efficient. This approach, combined
            with its component-based architecture, enables developers to build
            scalable and maintainable applications with a seamless user
            experience.

            Before diving into React, itâ€™s helpful to have a solid foundation in
            the following areas:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>HTML & CSS</strong>: Understanding how to structure web
              pages and style them is essential, as React components often
              render HTML and rely on CSS for design.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>JavaScript (ES6+)</strong>: Familiarity with modern
              JavaScript features like arrow functions, destructuring, template
              literals, and modules is crucial since React heavily relies on
              ES6+ syntax.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Basic DOM Manipulation</strong>: Knowing how to interact
              with the DOM using JavaScript will help you understand how React
              simplifies this process with its virtual DOM.
            </li>
